# Time-Series Analysis for GPS Data
 This project analyzes synthetic and real-life GPS data to study periodicities using autocorrelation and periodogram functions. It simulates GPS data with daily and weekly cycles, adds noise, and evaluates algorithm performance. The project also applies these methods to the Geolife dataset to identify mobility patterns and periodic behaviors
